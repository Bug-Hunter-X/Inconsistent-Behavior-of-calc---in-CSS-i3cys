The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected behavior when used with percentages and viewport units (vw, vh).  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10vw);` might not render correctly in all browsers or situations.  The calculation might be performed in an unexpected order or context leading to incorrect widths or other layout issues.  Another area that is less common is nesting `calc()` expressions, which can also lead to inconsistent results. For example `width: calc(calc(50% - 10vw) + 20px);` can be problematic. Also, using `calc()` with non-numeric values (strings) without proper quoting can cause issues.  A poorly written `calc()` expression might even cause a CSS parsing error.
